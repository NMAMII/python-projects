# AutoClusterPDFs 

## Overview

**PDFClusterAI** is an AI-powered tool that organizes research papers (PDFs) into clusters based on their abstract content. By leveraging **Sentence Transformers** for generating embeddings and **K-Means** clustering, it automatically groups the PDFs by topic or content similarity. This tool helps researchers or students to efficiently categorize and manage their research papers.

## Features

- **Automatic Abstract Extraction**: Extracts the abstract section from research papers.
- **Text Embedding using AI**: Converts the abstract into meaningful embeddings using pre-trained models.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Clusters the PDFs into groups based on their abstract content.
- **Automatic Folder Organization**: Moves the PDFs into corresponding cluster folders.
