This folder is where to put the pdf files, in order to test the code I downloaded a few of varies topics to test the code's ability to preform the clustering. 
The website that was used for downloading the PDFs is: 
[freefullpdf](https://www.freefullpdf.com)
* make sure that the pdfs have an abstract then an introduction, conclusion, etc.. like in the code (that's the way most article is structured) if not it'll skip the abstract extraction part for that file.
